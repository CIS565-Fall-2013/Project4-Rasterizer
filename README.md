CUDA Rasterizer in Progress
Credits: 
1. One small function from the NVIDIA forums: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/492068/atomicmin-with-float/ on atomicMin for floats, which is a modified version of "our own" atomicAdd from the slides. I had to modify the code anyway because it wasn't completely correct.
2. Some snippets from http://sol.gfxile.net/tri/index.html. It isn't even a complete implementation, it's a blog post with a few code snippets.
